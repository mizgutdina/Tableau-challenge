## Dashboard 1: 2019 vs 2020 Analysis of Trips

Trip duration and number of trips taken by Citi bike users were analyzed for 2019 and 2020. 
Based on the available data, it can be concluded that in 2019, users took larger number of trips for shorter durations, while in 2020, we saw a reversed trend, with the smaller number of trips, and increased duration. 

In 2020, utilization can be analyzed in the context of stay-at-home orders issued by the governors of New York and New Jersey in response to the global pandemic. After the first lockdown restrictions were imposed in late March, utilization plummeted dramatically. Both number of trips and trip duration was at all-time low in April. Ridership peak coincided with lockdown being lifted in June 2020. 

Overall, trends in Citi bike utilization could be elucidated by the global pandemic, and users' quest for additional means of public transportation. While trains and buses do not allow ample space for social distancing, bikes could be a valid alternative. It is possible that users were taking longer trips to avoid using public transportation.  

It was notable that there were more customers in addition to usual subscribers utilizing the service in 2020 rather than in 2019, which can also be linked to pandemic. The start and end station with a highest number of trips was Groves St. PATH. This station is located on the PATH train station, a transit hub between New York and New Jersey. It is very likely, that people utilize a train to commute between the two cities and rely on bikes to take them to the target destination or workplace while in New York.  

While in 2020, top 15 destination stations were similar in counts of total trips, JC Medical Center station has seen an increase in utilization compared to 2019. In the face of public health emergency, it is possible that riders seeking medical attention would utilize bikes as means of transportation at increased rate. 

## Dashboard 2: Gender and Age

The breakdown of trip number and duration demonstrated that both females and males took longer trips in 2020, although total number of trips was smaller in 2020 than in 2019. Despite a significant increase in ridership for both sexes in 2020, overall, females utilized Citi bikes much less than males. This is supported by multiple studies which have shown that females tend to depend on public transportation more and be over-represented in 'essential' professions (Source: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242476).

Similar average age demographics utilizes the bikes for both genders - from mid to late thirties. It is possible that younger generations tend to own a bicycle, and older - rely on other means of transportation such as personal vehicles, trains and buses.

Detailed view on the relationship between the customer age and the total trip duration showed that 52-year-olds took the longest trips. Graph was also affected by outliers shown as customers over 100 years old, which might have been caused by mistyped/misreported data.

## Map 
Top 15 Start and Top 15 End stations were similar in make-up. Most visited stations were associated with hubs for other means of transportation, such as various PATH and light rail stations. It is evident from the data, that people using multiple modes of transportation utilize bikes to get to the point of transfer, for example users who live in New Jersey and work in New York rely on Citi bikes to get to the train stations.
